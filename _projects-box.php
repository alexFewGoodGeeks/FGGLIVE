                <h3>Challenge:</h3>
                <p>Being a highly successful business information aggregation company, a Swiss client decided to change and improve their digital appearance. They turned to the geeks with a request for a highly skilled front end developer and an exceptional web designer who would capture the essence of their ideology and business prowess and successfully encapsulate all that in a masterfully created web site.</p>
                <h3>Solution:</h3>
                <p>The detailed conversations with the client led us to a complete understanding of the company’s business culture and their highly professional criteria. Our immediate response to their request was to comb through our resources of developers and utilize our capacity in Macedonia, while, simultaneously, mapping out unusually skillful designers in the Balkan area. After sifting through the initial 100 identified potential options, we reduced the list down to only 3 developer and 4 designer candidates. The client was impressed with the geeks we offered which led to a continual business relationship.</p>
